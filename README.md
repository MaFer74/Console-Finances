# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

## Overview

In this challenge, I used some skills that we learned in class about the use of strings, functions, console log and the use of parameters to calculate numbers. The most difficult and yet helpful part was create a pseudo code and a sybntax to make the code run.
Overall it was and still is a particular difficult task to create a running code. I had to get help from a class tutor and some code support online, but it is done


The task required to proof the below statements which it has been done:
  Financial Analysis 
  ----------------
  Total Months: 86
  
  Total: $38382578
  
  Average Change: -2315.12
  
  Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  
  Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  
## Usage 

As the name of the project says, this exercise could be use to do a follow up of the yearly finances and application can vary and be adapted to different set ups in the finance department, for instance to track the particular high or low season of productivity of a particular business, etc.

Because of the type of challenge, this particular project does not require a table of contents neither a further description, as it self explanatory


## Credits

TA: It was an amazing support and collaboration from our bootcamp: Kayvon, whom took extra time to explain to me the logic and tried to guide me in understanding hot to create a code that runs and fulfilled the requirements.

Internet research: Just as a guide i used Stack overflow and ww3
